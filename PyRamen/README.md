## PyRamen Program
* This program takes sales receipts from a Ramen shop and calculates total profit, cost, and revenue for each item
* It reads in a *menu_data.csv* file and a *sales_data.csv* file, then builds data structures to quickly analyze and track data that is then printed to a report
* in the **main.py** program, the user can choose to print the findings to a *report.txt* file by including '--reportfile' before the *.csv* files
> cmd line usg: python main.py --reportfile menu_data.csv sales_data.csv
